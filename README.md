# MVC_emp

### MVC Architecture Pattern:
MVC (Model-View-Controller) is an architectural design pattern used in software engineering to create applications with a clear separation of concerns. It divides the application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. Each component has a specific role to play in the application and interacts with the other components in a predefined way.

The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for storing and retrieving data, as well as performing calculations and other operations. The Model component is independent of the user interface and can be reused in different applications.

The View represents the user interface of the application. It is responsible for displaying the data to the user and receiving input from the user. The View component is typically implemented using a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit such as Swing or JavaFX.

The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and View components. It is responsible for receiving input from the user through the View, processing it using the Model, and updating the View with the results. The Controller component also handles events and manages the overall flow of the application.
